            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>THOU art here preſented with two Diſcourſes conjoined, in Vindication of <hi>Proteſtant Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> the publiſhing whereof is become highly neceſſary, by reaſon of the heavy charges wherewith the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are lately loaded by the <hi>Reverend Dr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet Dean of St. Pauls,</hi> in his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Separation;</hi> and by the Authors of two Anſwers to <hi>a Letter from a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to a Perſon of Quality, ſhewing ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for his Nonconformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There hath been already publiſhed <hi>a modeſt and peaceable Inquiry into the deſign and nature of ſome of thoſe Hiſtorical miſtakes that are found in the Doctors Preface to the
<pb facs="tcp:100810:3"/>aforenamed Book, wherein the innocency of Proteſtant Diſſenters is cleared up and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the Doctors indecent cenſuſes;</hi> and theſe Diſcourſes come after to encounter the body of his Book.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Diſcourſe we appeal to all our Neighbour <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> touching our ſincerity; giving them an <hi>Hiſtorical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of the <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>growth</hi> of thoſe thing which are the cauſes of our diviſions; and then leaving them to judg where the faut lyes, and whether theſe heavy charges of the Doctors are not unmerited.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is principally calculated for the Meridian of the <hi>two Anonymous Authors</hi> of the aforeſaid Anſwers, where human invention is elevated many degrees above Divine Revelation; but may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſerve for an anſwer to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100810:3"/>charges of <hi>Schiſme</hi> and <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be here objected, Is this a time to diſpute about theſe ſmaller things, when the Church is like to be ſwallowed up of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the Holy Cloy it ſelf rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be trod under foot of the Gentiles, and our common Enemy will rejoyce to ſee Proteſtant againſt Proteſtant, (that they may divide the ſpoil) and ſo great a Champion of the Proteſtant Cauſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed?</p>
            <p>To this ſeveral things muſt be ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf as a Proteſtant ought to have conſidered this, and not have given this provocation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as the <hi>Doctor</hi> and his Party may
<pb facs="tcp:100810:4"/>write for their Way when they will, why ſhould others neglect the <hi>year of releaſe,</hi> which falls out but once in an age? It is not long ſince we were under the Hatches, and had not leave to give our Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Conformity,</hi> nor were allowed to be once heard, till about Two thouſand Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters were ſilenced.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the <hi>Reverend Doctor,</hi> he hath done ſo worthily in this our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his ſo <hi>learned Writings</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that he deſerves well of all <hi>good Proteſtants;</hi> but yet ſeeing the learned <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> ſeems to have repented of his former Writings, particularly his <hi>Irenicum</hi> [hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſince the writing of that Book to much applauded and congratulated the happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh Prelacy</hi> to its wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed luſter and grandure, far enough from his formerly deſired reduction to <hi>Primitive
<pb facs="tcp:100810:4"/>Presbyteries</hi>] I know not but he may find as good reaſon here for his repenting this his Book againſt <hi>Diſſenting Proteſtants.</hi> For the end of his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Irenicum</hi> may be recanted, but never reconciled to the beginning of his <hi>Epiſile</hi> to Archbiſhop <hi>Land</hi>'s Defence againſt <hi>Fiſher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What pity ſo grave and great a man ſhould thus expoſe himſelf by a Conteſt too palpable between <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Now tho' this his Book hath the laſt word, and carries it with the world, yet the elder Brother will be accounted the honeſter with the wiſe, becauſe born of the Free-woman; while the after-ſeed was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and brought forth in bondage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It may be judged a fit ſeaſon of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Kingly Power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the government of his own Houſe,
<pb facs="tcp:100810:5"/>when men ſo liberally give away the Lords prerogative. Our Pulpits now ſo ring with a Catholick <hi>Jus Civile,</hi> that there is ſcarce any <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> left, but of <hi>Tythes,</hi> which I hope they will hold to the laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good <hi>Church men.</hi> A fair Charter hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſealed to his <hi>Church</hi> with his own blood, giving her <hi>Officers, Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>free Courts</hi> within her ſelf; all which ſome unfaithful children with prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> often ſell for Morſels of Meat.</p>
            <p>Now could men let Chriſt alone to govern his own Houſe in his own Way, by his own <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> how happy ſhould we be? Who can better reprove the Atheiſm of the world in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up mans poſt by <hi>Chriſts,</hi> than Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath done in his other Works, while he ſaith, that <hi>to ſay a man may be of any Religion according to the laws of
<pb facs="tcp:100810:5"/>men, is to take it for granted that there is no ſuch thing as Religion in the World. And again, that no men do ſo dangerouſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the foundation of Civil Government, as thoſe who maguifie it to the Contempt of Religion. Politicians</hi> and <hi>Court-Paraſites</hi> muſt not dare to form a <hi>Religion</hi> in the flexible mould of <hi>State.</hi> A <hi>Municipal Religion</hi> would many fain promote, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Reaſons of State,</hi> more than <hi>Rules of Conſcience;</hi> like the <hi>Heathens,</hi> who firſt built <hi>Cities,</hi> and then inſtituted a <hi>Religion</hi> ſit for the <hi>Inbabitants.</hi> The <hi>Roman Inspire</hi> flouriſhed, while vertue was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; to ſhew, faith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py they ſhould be, who ſhould have <hi>Religion</hi> ſuperadded. And indeed they had no better <hi>Subjects</hi> than <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> for none can give onto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> upon any valuable or
<pb facs="tcp:100810:6"/>holding Account, who make no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of giving unto <hi>God</hi> the things that are <hi>Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How the learned and unprejudiced (if it fall into ſuch hands) ſhall find this Defence managed, <hi>Judicium ſit poenes lectorem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now may the <hi>moſt High,</hi> after all the encroachments on the <hi>Scepter of his Son</hi> in the World, bring back the hearts of this People to himſelf, making them yield to the internal <hi>Government</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the True <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> and ancient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Government of his houſe; that the Glory of the latter Houſe may be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Glory of the former, even a Spiritual Glory of the Power of the Lord may appear among us; and the
<pb facs="tcp:100810:6"/>
               <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> may proſper by his own <hi>Ordinances</hi> in the hands of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Servants,</hi> as the beauty of his houſe, and the bleſſing of his choſen, <hi>Amen.</hi> Even ſo <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> let thy <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come!</hi>

            <p>FOR the full and clear underſtanding of the ſtate of the controverſie between <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> it will be abſolutely neceſſary (eſpecially ſince we appeal to Proteſtants abroad) to give an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical account of the riſe and growth of our Differences from the beginning of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Know then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>firſt reformers</hi> in the days of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> though of ſeveral judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about the external part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were all of honeſt Principles and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their Doctrine, and had the ſame mind and deſign to purge the then preſent Church of its Idolatry, Superſtitions and groſs Errors, and to bring in the ſame pure Doctrine that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by <hi>Calvin</hi> and the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> and which hath been, and is ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100810:8"/>
            <p n="2">2. That the ſaid <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> being divided in their Opinions about retaining that which was good, and taking away whatſoever was amiſs in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> as to the outward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Opinion that the <hi>Reformation</hi> could not be thoroughly done for matter of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and externals, as it was poſſible for matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> prevailed ſo far with Biſhop <hi>Hooper, Rogers,</hi> and others that wiſht it had been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as to make them forbear any further urging of a compleat <hi>Reformation,</hi> in hopes that when the people that were inſtructed in the true ſaving Doctrine, ſhould be more numerous, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to a thorough Reformation in all points would be leſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this <hi>rude draught</hi> of <hi>Reformation,</hi> ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that time, had very bad ſucceſs, becauſe the <hi>Conformable Party</hi> prevailed to have it a ſtanding law, which was neither to be repealed nor alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which drew along with it <hi>Non-Reſidency, Plurality of Livings,</hi> and <hi>entward Pomp</hi> and <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,</hi> as beſt ſuiting a worldly intereſt, whilſt another <hi>Party,</hi> who were then called <hi>Puritans,</hi> and now <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> retained, and ſtill do to our days, a deſire and longing after a <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Reformation,</hi> and they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100810:8"/>by Conferences, Remonſtrances, and Writings, to have it introduced.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That yet the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> were not all of one mind, there being ſtill a party among them very peaceable and orthodox, and at leſs diſtance from the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> eſpecially among the Gentry, that were no Courtiers, and in great Towns, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Corporations, whileſt the other Party, made up of <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> grew corrupt, and ſo far from hearkening to a further Reformation, that they made nearer advances towards <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That Jealouſies and apprehenſions daily encreaſing, and fears of inclining to <hi>Popery,</hi> and the Troubles in <hi>Scotland</hi> intervening in the Years 38, and 39; and the Diſcontents riſing up in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> was forced to call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which began in 1640.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That that <hi>Parliament,</hi> both <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> was moſt, if not all, compoſed of ſuch peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Orthodox Church of <hi>England</hi> men I have but now mentioned, and all conforming to the Rites, Ceremonies of Epiſcopacy and Hierarchy, but yet greatly averſe to Popery, Tyranny, and the Corrupt party of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that inclined to wards <hi>Rome;</hi> Witneſs the many <hi>Speeches</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> they made, as of the Lord <hi>Faulckland,</hi> Sir <hi>Benjamin Rudyer, Digby,</hi> and others, with whom Good and Honeſt Biſhops joyned.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100810:9"/>
            <p n="7">7. That the Ground and Riſe of the Civil War in 1640, and 43, was in oppoſition to ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Land,</hi> and other bad inſtruments.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in 1642, and 43, were all in perfect Conformity to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſo was the Army too that they raiſed; for the General, the main Body of the Army, the Officers and Captains both by Land and Sea, were all <hi>conformable</hi> to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and none of them <hi>Puritans, Presbyterians, Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Sectaries,</hi> or <hi>Conventiclers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. That likewiſe, the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter,</hi> choſen by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> were all <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> and none of them <hi>Silenced Miniſters,</hi> except 8. or 9, and 4 <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. That the firſt Intentions of the <hi>Parliament</hi> was ſo far from ſubverting the Government of Church and State, eſtabliſhed by Law, and from taking away the Houſe of Lords and Biſhops root and branch; that it was only to reform the abuſes of both, and to ſettle ſuch a Model of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as was recommended by the Pious and learned Biſhops, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> and which did not much differ from that which our <hi>Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign</hi> that now is, recommended to his <hi>parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in his <hi>Declaration</hi> 1660. about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That the <hi>parliament</hi> had no thoughts of

            <p n="12">12. That no man was obliged by it to take away <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but only as they are in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchy.</p>
            <p n="13">13.

            <p n="14">14. That the Change, or Subverſion of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the taking away the <hi>Lords Houſe,</hi> and with them the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and excluding the greateſt part of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and laſt of all, the taking away the <hi>King,</hi> and all the Confuſions, and Diſorders, that happened thereupon, did ariſe from a third Party, <hi>viz.</hi> The Army, that was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the <hi>King,</hi> nor <hi>parliament;</hi> Neither for <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> nor for <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> but was an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to them all, and ſought their abſolute ruine and deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="15">15.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100810:10"/>Martyr; and being contrivers of his Death, and of taking away Monarchy; that on the contrary, it was the only party (while the others of the <hi>King</hi>'s Friends ſate ſtill) that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and ſince 48, in his behalf, to the hazard of their Lives (witneſs Mr. <hi>love,</hi>) and that in 1660, had a chief hand in reſtoring our gracious Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> the II. to his Throne; for which never enough to be valued Benefit and kindneſs, although it was but duty, no Party has been more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely perſecuted by the Corrupt-party of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> But of this, more anon.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That the <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> mentioned in the Tenth Conſideration, was a confirmation of another former <hi>Declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. That whereas, when the <hi>King</hi> came over from the <hi>Hague,</hi> there was a great expectation that his Printed <hi>Declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> would be ſufficient to compoſe all differences and heats, and unite all Parties, by taking away the ſtumbling block of ſubſcribing to thoſe Ceremonies that were not warranted by the Word of God; but juſt on the contrary, the Clamours of the Corrupt Party of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at length prevail'd for reſtoring of thoſe Ceremonies. All which good Biſhop <hi>Brownrig</hi> foretold, a little before his Death, in ſaying, That there would continue the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions and Animoſities, that were before; and, with them, the ſame ſpirit of Perſecution which the Corrupt Church-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before 1640, was the cauſe of.</p>
            <p n="18">18. That the Zeal and Fervour of the prevailing Corrupt Church-Party in <hi>England</hi> at this preſent juncture of time, in writing ſo many Books againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſtanding up ſo ſtoutly againſt the Horid Attempt upon the <hi>King</hi>'s moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Life, and introducing of <hi>Popery,</hi> and hearkening to ſome terms of Reconciliation with the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> to make the oppoſition the ſtronger againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> does no way ſeem to be the effect of a Chriſtian Moderation, but a meer worldly Intereſt, like the zeal of <hi>Jehu,</hi> the union of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> two Mortal Foes againſt the Common Enemy. Or like that of <hi>Auguſtus, Brutus,</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100810:10"/>
               <hi>Caſsius,</hi> againſt <hi>Antony:</hi> 'Tis the goodneſs of a ſtubborn Boy, juſt ſo long as the Rod is over his Back; for had another ſpirit moved the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than a Worldly one, it would have appeared above theſe 10 Years; when (alas!) no ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made by the <hi>Papists</hi> againſt their Lives, and Livings, when a Hundred Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances were made to them, with Prayers and Tears, for the removing of the offending Rites and Ceremonies; and of the great inclination they had for Popery, in depopulating <hi>England,</hi> by driving men away to Colonies abroad: but could never be heard.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Things being thus ſtated, one may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally and ſtrongly conclude, That it is a moſt horrid untruth, and calumnie to make the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Conventiclers,</hi> or <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> not only the firſt authors, and abettors of the Civil Wars, and of the firſt taking up of Arms in oppoſition to the Evil Counſellors about the <hi>King</hi> in 42 and 43, but alſo the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of <hi>King Charles</hi> the Firſt; when as they have been, and ſtill are the great preſervers of the <hi>King</hi>'s Perſon, Life, Honours, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Prerogatives; the beſt Chriſtians, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100810:11"/>beſt Reformed, and the beſt Subjects of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22. And the falſe and unworthy ſtiling of theſe Reſtorers of the <hi>King, Rebels, Fanaticks, Sons of Belial,</hi> &amp;c. doth carry along with it the ſame devilliſh Malice; which makes it now become a common Proverb in the Mouths of this corrupt Church of <hi>England</hi>-Party, That they had rather be <hi>papists,</hi> than <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> and that were there a Turn of State, (as God forbid) they would ſooner turn <hi>papists,</hi> than <hi>presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="23">23. beſides, the idle, fooliſh, ſenceleſs, but alſo malicious miſtake, to make the holieſt of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> to paſs for <hi>presbyterians,</hi> who, though they love their perſons, and the holineſs of their Doctrine, and Lives, yet either they are wholly avenſe to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or elſe they do not very well know what it means; Since the Well-affected fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Preaching, and imitate their Lives, but yet by no means upon any account of their Government.</p>
            <p n="24">24. That the worſt thing in the carriage of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100810:11"/>the <hi>Conformists</hi> towards the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> is their raſh, uncharitable, and unchriſtian judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the hearts and Inſides of men, (which are only known to <hi>god Almighty,</hi> who is the Searcher of hearts,) as if they were made up of Deceit and Hipocriſie; and alike conſtruing their unblameable behaviour and carriage, as if it were but formal, and extrinſecal, and of the pure, Orthodox Doctrine of their Sermons and Writings, though never ſo much ſummed up in Scripture phraſes, as if all was but <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Tone,</hi> and taking of God's Name in vain; when they make a quite different Judgment of the <hi>Conformists,</hi> both of their Lives and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and when they make uſe of the ſame Scripture terms as the others do; for in their eſteem they are looked upon as true, ſincere, and holy Chriſtians, though their out ward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment do ſomewhat differ from that of the other.</p>
            <p>this I intend, by God's aſſiſtance, to make dear to you in a larger Diſcourſe, from the teſtimony of Dr. <hi>patrick,</hi> who doubtleſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, in handling of the Nature of Juſtification by Faith, but agree with the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> in making uſe of the ſame Scripture-Expreſſions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100810:12"/>and commend ſuch as Biſhop <hi>Davenant, Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, Uſher, Hall,</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> all <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> for doing the like, and who will tell us, that this Juſtification by Faith is <hi>a Recumbency of a poor Sinner upon the Lord Jeſus Christ; a casting of our ſelves upon him, relying on his Merits, laying hold on him, cloſing with him, going to him, and ſhrowding our ſelves under the Robes of his Righteouſneſs:</hi> Moſt of which are Scripture phraſes: But yet for all this, the very ſame Expreſſions, being uttered by ſuch <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> as mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen, Manton, Anneſly, Jacomb, Bates,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenkins, Alſoph, Cradock, Silvester, Watſon, and others,</hi> for the better ſetting out the nature of Juſtification by Faith, are looked upon by Dr. <hi>patrick,</hi> as meer Impoſters, Charms, Incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, artificial Jugglings, Terms of Modiſt and Courtly Faith, by which this Doctor makes good the ſaying of <hi>pliny</hi> the younger, <hi>Epist.</hi> 21. <hi>multum intereſt quid à quo<expan>

            <p>That ſuch a prejudice againſt the Generation of God's Children, that make it their grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to get an aſſurance of Heaven and of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as are, not only many of the Peaceable

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall inſiſt very particularly upon ſome very conſiderable Inferences and Concluſions which I ſhall draw from ſome <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> that I have already taken notice of, but which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too often inculcated; the truth of which is known ſufficiently by thoſe that are moſt Eminent in Piety and Holineſs of Living, and in Learning, of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by the Biſhops <hi>Hooper, Smith, Rudd, Carleton, Grindall,</hi> the two <hi>Abbots, Uſher, hall,</hi> and by other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors that were as <hi>Conformable</hi> as thoſe Biſhops.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though the firſt Reformation in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, was wxtremely pure as to its Doctrine, it was notwithſtanding very defective and imperfect as to the exterior Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becauſe it was adjuſted to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time where the <hi>papists</hi> were twenty, for One, that was reformed in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100810:13"/>
            <p n="2">2. That the firſt Reformers imagined, that when the People, converted to the true Faith, ſhould be more Numerous, and more diſpoſed to receive a more perfect Reformation, The Succeſſors of the firſt Reformers would apply themſelves to it with more Earneſtneſs and Zeal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But it never came into their thoughts, that their Succeſſors would be guilty of ſo great a fault, as to act the quite contrary to ſuch a good Project and Deſign, in perſuading both Princes and Parliaments to bring the firſt <hi>Rude Draught</hi> of Reformation into a <hi>ſtanding Law:</hi> but only to have it eſtabliſhed for a certain time, untill they themſelves ſhould ſee they were able to effect a more perfect Reformation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Practice of theſe Succeſſors of the firſt Reformers hath been unreaſonable, wicked, impious, and cruel; in the Impoſition of ſeveral things, which they themſelves have owned not to be neceſſary, and at beſt but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, under <hi>pain</hi> of deprivation <hi>ab officio &amp; beneficio;</hi> although all the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> have not been equally guilty, for ſome among them have approved of theſe meaſures they have taken towards the <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> but yet have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100810:13"/>connived at them either by their ſubmiſſion, or their ſilence, and have not vigorouſly enough ſet themſelves againſt the Corruption that ſo much prevailed.</p>
            <p>From all theſe <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> I gather theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, which naturally follow the aforeſaid Premiſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſeveral Biſhops and Doctors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Floyd,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Patrick,</hi> that are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> to be Perſons of great Learning, Worth, and Piety, but who are Extreme Admirers of the Epiſcopacy of <hi>England,</hi> and all its Conſequences, and who have alſo preferred its Government to all other Eſtabliſhments in <hi>Europe,</hi> have by an unlucky accident, contributed more towards the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchie, and its Practiſes, and towards the perpetuating the Feuds and Quarrels between the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> and <hi>Non-Conformiſts,</hi> than it has been poſſible for any other Corrupted Party to do by all their Irregularities, and advances towards <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That it may be ſaid of theſe good Biſhops and Doctors before mentioned, what the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique Sages have obſerved of <hi>Anſelme, Bernard, Thomas Aquinas, John of Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Gerſon,</hi> That by their great repute of Piety, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100810:14"/>they have contributed more to the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Tyranny, and Religion, in the Minds of the People, than a hundred ſuch as <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII, and <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIII. were able to effect by their Tyranny, and the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impurity of their Lives, for the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting of the Pope and his Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is not to be believed how much the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſuffer in the Eſteem of our Great Men of the Proteſtant Party in <hi>Europe;</hi> who, hearing people talk of the Learning and Piety of ſo many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Doctors, all <hi>Conformists,</hi> and who reſemble thoſe four Doctors I have juſt before named, ſay aloud, that the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> muſt needs be very unreaſonable, and of a very nice and fantaſtical Piety, for refuſing to Conform to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> after the Example of thoſe four Doctors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That how good ſoever the Intentions of ſome of the Biſhops and Doctors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> may be, that are of the ſame temper of ſpirit with theſe four Doctors, and what kindneſs ſoever they may have for the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists;</hi> it is impoſſible They ſhould ever come over to them, and conſent to terms of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and Moderation, ſo long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in this Judgment and Opinion, That of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100810:14"/>all the Eſtabliſhed Eccleſiaſtical Governments in <hi>Europe,</hi> that of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the moſt excellent, and the moſt <hi>Apostolical,</hi> and that there is nothing of defect in it; and ſo long as the multitude of their Benefices, and the great honour they are in, in the World, blinds their Judgment, there being no likelihood, nor hopes, that thoſe, who are raiſed ſo high, and that live in honour and abundance, richly, and fatly, (unleſs they will imitate good Dr. <hi>Floyd,</hi> who beſtowes moſt of his Church-Revenues on the Poor,) will diminiſh any thing of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both as to their Retinue, or their Kitchin, and will deſcend from high to low; and that a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> who now goes before the <hi>Barons,</hi> will quit his Place, to be only a poor ſimple Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, and Watchman over a ſmall company of <hi>Priests,</hi> ſuch as were St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin:</hi> For this Eminence of Fortune and Dignity does abſolutely ſhut up the door to all the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Reformation, which we learn from <hi>Mounſieur Claude</hi> in his Defence of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> where he tells us, That the Cardinal <hi>du Prat,</hi> for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was the moſt violent of all men, and the moſt inraged againſt <hi>Luther</hi>'s Reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was provided of Five Biſhopricks, and I know not how many other good and fat Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100810:15"/>
            <p>That for theſe Reaſons, Methinks, it might be expected from theſe good Biſhops and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that by a Chriſtian condeſcention, they would endeavour to incline their Brethren the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> to abate ſomething of their heat and vigorouſneſs againſt the <hi>Non-Conformists;</hi> but ſo long as they themſelves are neither ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any error or defect in their Church, it is not to be expected, or hoped for from them, that they ſhould go about the doing of any ſuch good work, how great and eminent ſoever they be, no more than it ought to be expected from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors, ſo long as they do look upon, and verily believe, their Church to be infallible.</p>
            <p>And therefore it cannot be conſiderately ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that the perfect day of hope, of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Reformation, and of the Reconciliation of the <hi>Conformists</hi> to the <hi>Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists,</hi> ſhould break forth from theſe good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Doctors, nor from any of the Clergy, but from KINGS, and the Princes of the People, whoſe hearts are in <hi>God</hi>'s hands, and who holds them as the Rivers of Waters.</p>
            <p n="25">25. As for the <hi>Odium</hi> that is caſt upon the <hi>Congregational Way,</hi> and thoſe who are called <hi>Independents,</hi> as being the more immediate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and abettors of the <hi>King</hi>'s Murther, and of taking away <hi>Monarchy,</hi> it can be eaſily wiped
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100810:15"/>off, and made out, That <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi>'s Army, like that of King <hi>David</hi>'s in the Wilderneſs, was a Medley or a Collection of all Parties that were diſcontented, as ſome <hi>Courtiers,</hi> ſome <hi>Epiſcoparians,</hi> few of any Sect, but moſt of none, or elſe of the Religion of <hi>Thomas Hobbes,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Scarborough,</hi> not mentioning the <hi>Papists,</hi> who had the greateſt hand in the Death of <hi>King Charles</hi> the Firſt; the ſucceſs of which made them ſo daring and impious, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive another moſt Damnable and Helliſh Plot to cut off the Life of his Sacred Majeſty that now is, how Royal Son, and our moſt Gracious Soveraign.</p>
            <p n="26">26. That ſince the <hi>Non-Conformiſts</hi> were a generation of men, either of the firſt date (as it is moſt likely,) or, at leaſt, that roſe in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> at the ſame time as the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> did; and ſince they were for number and quality, as great, or rather greater, and more conſiderate than the other, and who, in their Judgment, came nearer, as to the outward Government, and Purity of Worſhip, not only to the firſt Reformers, <hi>Zuinglius, Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Practice; and who, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were the <hi>TRUE PROTESTANTS,</hi> moſt Conformable to that Party in <hi>Germany,</hi> who ſo ſtiled themſelves <hi>Protestants,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
